## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project guard` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project guard`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project guard` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file. 

## Build

Run `ng build guard` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
